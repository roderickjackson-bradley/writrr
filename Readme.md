# Writrr

Writrr is a hub to discover, share, and market the creative endeavors that writers produce and enjoy.

A Writrr can recommend or add content that they feel the world should see, giving them a new platform to monetize their work. 

A registered account can also add content they want others to discover and subscribe to. They can also recommend to others that inspire them, and they can purchase content directly from the Writtr. 

A journal entry, an article, a book excerpt... the user can interact and purchase directly from the Writtr's hub (Oeuvre)

Once at the Writrr's outpost(Oeuvre), the user can rate the original content, engage with the Writrr, browse to see what recommendations they have outside of their own content, purchase items the Writrr has up for sale, or subscribe to premium content the Writrr may offer.
