Writrr is a hub to discover, share, and market the creative endeavors that writers produce and enjoy.

A Writrr can recommend or add content that they feel the world should see, giving them a new platform to monetize their work. 

A registered account can also add content they want others to discover and subscribe to. They can also recommend to others that inspire them, and they can purchase content directly from the Writtr. 

A journal entry, an article, a book excerpt... the user can interact and purchase directly from the Writtr's hub (Oeuvre)

Once at the Writrr's outpost(Oeuvre), the user can rate the original content, engage with the Writrr, browse to see what recommendations they have outside of their own content, purchase items the Writrr has up for sale, or subscribe to premium content the Writrr may offer. 

The “Opus View” will be available on an individual entry for each post by a writer.  the Opus view will allow the user to view the writer entry, and leave a comment if I am a “reader”( person who has registered). A reader will also be able to rate the story favorably ( “Writt.r.Die” ) or unfavorably ( “Writtr.Sigh” ) , and buy that entry if the writer has enabled it for sale by clicking the ("Writt.r.Buy") button/link.

The “Activity Stream” will be available for a user who has signed-in as a "Reader" or a "Writer" upon clicking "Log-in" or completion of "Sign-up". The Activity Stream will be the home page, and will allow the user to see "Opus" posts that have been uploaded by Writers.

The "Activity Stream" view will allow the user to click on a writer's "Opus"  entry, and upon clicking, the user will be taken to that "Opus view" until the user decides to navigate away.

A reader or writer will be able to use the feature by clicking the using the "sign-in" button on initial log-in.

The “Shop” view will be available for a user who has signed-in as a "Reader" or a "Writer" upon clicking "Log-in" or completion of "Sign-up", has selected an "Opus" entry, and has clicked on the "Shop" button for that entry.

The Shop view will allow the user to request to purchase the "Opus" posts that have been uploaded by Writers.

A reader or writer will only be able to use the feature by successfully using the "sign-in" button on initial log-in.
